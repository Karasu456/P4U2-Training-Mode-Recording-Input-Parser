# P4U2 Training Mode Recording Input Parser
 Made by カラス, or カラス#2227 on discord. If any issues are found with the tool, message me here about it ;) This tool parses training mode recording inputs found within P4U2's save.dat file. It does so by converting the stored hexidecimal data, for these inputs, into readable input data. To best utilize this tool, pair the output gathered from it with Kiwi515's P4U2 Trial Editor and use it to build working demonstration inputs.
